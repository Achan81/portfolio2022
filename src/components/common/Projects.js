      A 12-week immersive course learning fundamentals of web programming from front end to back end (focussed on JavaScript, React.js, HTML and CSS). 
      The course consisted of daily stand-ups, online-lessons, labs, pair-coding, group & individual projects where we learnt how to build Full-Stack applications.

          <p>A grid based shoot em up game built in JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
      Here I was able to apply everything learnt in the first few weeks and present it in the form of a single player game. 
      Although a classic arcade game, I focused on making sure the player controls and gameplay runs smoothly. 
      I also added up down controls feature to allow the user experience to be more advanced. 
      The styling is a mix of retro and contemporary, with a space themed background. 
      The game is not mobile friendly and sound files were corrupted when deploying. 
      I would very much like to revisit and improve the game further.</p>

      This project helped me to understand my own strengths and weaknesses at this stage of the course.

      We all worked Full-Stack, while my specific focus was on building the front end structure, CSS and designing to be mobile ready.

      Such as secure registration & log in, presenting dog index and search functionality, show pages. 
      Collectively we completed the Back End and seeded a database together. On the Front End we each had pages to build, my main contributions were the questionnaire forms and donation page.
