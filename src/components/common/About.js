        After spending over a decade in menswear fashion design, I wanted to move into a career that would challenge me and allow me to combine my design background and experience into programming.
        <br></br><br></br>
        A 12 week bootcamp at General Assembly (Software Engineering Immersive) was the perfect kick start to building my foundation skills and understanding. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        I now look forward to the next part of this journey to further my skills within creative and driven teams to contribute my experiences and continue to grow as a developer.</div>
